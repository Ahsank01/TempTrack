# TempTrack
Temp Track is a Web Application to fight COVID-19 exposure.

This is a Web Application that can be used for example in Restaurants, Hotels, Coffee Shops and so on. An employer can keep track of the health of his/her employees and customers. During this pandemic working, for example, in a restaurant is very risky. A manager/employer has to check your temperature as soon as you enter the building. At this time, most of them record the temperature with pen and paper. With Temp Track, it is faster and easier to maintain a more accurate record. At time of arrival, the manager/employer would open the application, insert the employee’s name, time, temperature and any notes that may be relevant. The manager will also have access to a Vaccine Locator and the latest news regarding the COVID-19 spread. The same process can be done for guests.
